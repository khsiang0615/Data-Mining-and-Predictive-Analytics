This project is to predict the suceessfulness of the funraising projects on the website KickStarter.com utilizing R programming language. 
First, the team added or cleaned more than 50 new features to the original data.
Then, We incorporated an external dataset and conducted text mining to increase the number of variables to maximize the accuary of our predictions.
Another interesting method we used was assembling our correct predictions on the unlabeled dataset and added it back to the training dataset for following predictions. 
Eventually, the team was able to achieve an accuracy around 80% on the unlabeled dataset with GBM boosting algorithm.
